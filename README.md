# üîê Authorization Patterns in JavaScript / React / Node

This repository contains **13 real-world examples** of implementing authorization in JavaScript / React / Node.js environments.  
Each folder represents a **standalone authorization strategy**, implemented as a fullstack mini-project.

## üìö Topics Covered

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Roles: admin, user, guest
   - Access based on user roles

2. **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**
   - Access based on user attributes (e.g. department, clearance level)

3. **Permission-Based Access Control**
   - Permissions like `can_view`, `can_edit`, `can_delete`

4. **JWT Authorization**
   - Token-based auth using JSON Web Tokens
   - Includes both frontend and backend

5. **Cookie-Based Authorization**
   - Authorization using HttpOnly cookies

6. **Server-Side Authorization**
   - Backend validates ownership before granting access

7. **OAuth2 / OpenID Connect**
   - Login via third-party providers (Google, GitHub)

8. **Firebase Rules**
   - Auth handled via Firebase security rules

9. **Context-Based Authorization**
   - React Context API-based auth state and access control

10. **Middleware Authorization**
    - Middleware logic on server or client to enforce access rights

11. **Route Guards**
    - Route-level protection in frameworks (React, Angular, Vue)

12. **Policy-Based Authorization**
    - Fine-grained access control using policies

13. **Feature Flag Authorization**
    - Restricting features based on user type or flags
